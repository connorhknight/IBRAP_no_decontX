\arguments{
\item{object}{An IBRAP class object}

\item{assay}{Character. Which assay within the IBRAP object to access. Default = NULL}

\item{test}{Character. Which test to use. Can be either: wilcox, bimod, roc, t, negbinom, poisson, LR, MAST, DESeq2. Please refer to Seurat::FindMarkers for more information.}

\item{identity}{Vector. A vector of cell identifiers to distinguish cells. Default = NULL}

\item{latent.vars}{Character. String(s) identifying which variables contained within the metadata to regress from the cells}

\item{...}{arguments to pass to Seurat::FindMarkers}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing differentially expression genes and other information
}
\description{
Performs differential expression on the assay differentiating the supplied identities, some methods enable variable regression, including: LR, negbinom, poisson or MAST. This function compares one cluster vs all others
